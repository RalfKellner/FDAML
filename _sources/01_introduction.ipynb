    "# Financial markets\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets can be distinguished based upon several criteria. We try to get an overview when categorizing financial markets by asset class. An asset is anything of value or a resource of value that can be owned or controlled to produce positive economic value for its owner or holder. In a broader economic sense, assets are crucial because they can be used to generate income, reduce expenses, or store value for future use. The concept of an asset is foundational in finance, accounting, and economics, guiding how individuals, businesses, and governments evaluate and manage their resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial markets by asset class may be split into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Equity markets (Stock markets): These markets deal with the trading of company shares or stock, including the primary market for new issues (IPOs) and the secondary market for trading existing securities. Major stock markets include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Shanghai Stock Exchange, with the NYSE being the largest in terms of total market capitalization.\n",
    "* Debt markets (Bond markets): Markets for trading debt instruments, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other types of debt financing. This market is crucial for governments and corporations to raise funds for various purposes, from infrastructure projects to operational financing.\n",
    "* Derivatives Markets: markets for trading contracts that derive their value from underlying assets, such as futures, options, and swaps. The derivatives market is vast and complex, with a notional value that far exceeds both the equity and bond markets (both are estimated around $100 trillion). Estimates of the global derivatives market range from hundreds of trillions to over a quadrillion dollars in notional value. Derivatives include futures, options, swaps, and other complex financial instruments used for hedging, speculation, and leveraging financial positions.\n",
    "* Foreign Exchange (Forex) markets: Markets for trading currencies, facilitating currency conversion for international trade and investments. The forex market is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily trading volume exceeding $6 trillion. This market operates 24 hours a day, facilitating currency trading and conversion around the globe.\n",
    "* Commodity markets: Markets for trading physical goods or raw products, such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. The size of commodity markets can vary greatly depending on the specific commodity (e.g., oil, gold, agricultural products). The total trading volume in commodities markets is in the trillions of dollars annually. Commodities are fundamental to the global economy, impacting industries, energy, food, and manufacturing.\n",
    "* Cryptocurrency markets: These are digital financial marketplaces where cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others, are traded. Further assets on these markets are various financial products and services within the blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) spaces, such as tokenized assets, stablecoins, and financial services that operate without traditional intermediaries. The cryptocurrency market is relatively small compared to traditional financial markets, but it has experienced rapid growth since its inception. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has fluctuated significantly, reaching over $2 trillion during its peak periods. Despite its smaller size, the cryptocurrency market is notable for its volatility, innovation, and the wide interest it has garnered among investors and technologists.\n",
